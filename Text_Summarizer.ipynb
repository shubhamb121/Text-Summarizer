        "House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler sent a letter to Trump on Tuesday notifying him of the hearing and inviting the President or his counsel to participate, including asking questions of the witnesses.\n",

        "\"We expect to discuss the constitutional framework through which the House may analyze the evidence gathered in the present inquiry,\" Nadler added. \"We will also discuss whether your alleged actions warrant the House's exercising its authority to adopt articles of impeachment.\"\n",
        "The Judiciary Committee hearing is the latest sign that House Democrats are moving forward with impeachment proceedings against the President following the two-month investigation led by the House Intelligence Committee into allegations that Trump pushed Ukraine to investigate his political rivals while a White House meeting and $400 million in security aid were withheld from Kiev.\n",
        "The hearing announcement comes as the Intelligence Committee plans to release its report summarizing the findings of its investigation to the House Judiciary Committee soon after Congress returns from its Thanksgiving recess next week.\n",
        "Democratic aides declined to say what additional hearings they will schedule as part of the impeachment proceedings.\n",
        "The Judiciary Committee is expected to hold multiple hearings related to impeachment, and the panel would debate and approve articles of impeachment before a vote on the House floor.\n",
